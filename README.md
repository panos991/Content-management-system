Good evening. In these photos, you can see two screens of my implementation in React 18. On the first screen, 
there is a form mechanism that fetches live data for the leavingFrom and goingTo lists. Additionally, there are validations for
the departDate and arrivalDate fields. There is also an option to specify the number of people participating in the flight. 
The form allows for multiple flight entries. On the next screen, the results are displayed, and there is also an option for additional filters.
